  Purpose:  Grade Book
A teacher has five students who have taken four tests. The teacher uses the following
grading scale to assign a letter grade to a student, based on the average of his or her
four test scores.
Test Score Letter Grade
90–100 A
80–89 B
70–79 C
60–69 D
0–59 F
Write a program that uses an array of string objects to hold the five student names,
an array of five characters to hold the five students’ letter grades, and five arrays of
four double s to hold each student’s set of test scores.
The program should allow the user to enter each student’s name and his or her four
test scores. It should then calculate and display each student’s average test score and a
letter grade based on the average.
Input Validation: Do not accept test scores less than 0 or greater than 100.
