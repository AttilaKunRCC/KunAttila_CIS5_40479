  Purpose:  Lo Shu Magic Square
The Lo Shu Magic Square is a grid with 3 rows and 3 columns shown in Figure 7-19 .
The Lo Shu Magic Square has the following properties:
• The grid contains the numbers 1 through 9 exactly.
• The sum of each row, each column, and each diagonal all add up to the same
number. This is shown in Figure 7-20 .
In a program you can simulate a magic square using a two-dimensional array. Write a
function that accepts a two-dimensional array as an argument, and determines whether
the array is a Lo Shu Magic Square. Test the function in a program.
